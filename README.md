This website can be found at the URL: [tiltobias.github.io](tiltobias.github.io)

The website is made using HTML, CSS with SCSS, Javascript and Firebase API as a real time database. 
It consists of a front/home page with a parallax scroll effect, a navigation bar with selfmade svg animations, a "create account" page, and a chat room page where you can send messages on a public forum if signed into an account.
